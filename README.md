# feedmI

feedmI is a social media manager web application.  In a day and age of 1.8 million different social media sites that we have to log into and post the same thing over and over again, life gets complicated!  We have to keep up with 
our friends on LinkedIn, Facebook, our Twitter followers and there goes our weekend...Enter feedmI, bringing our social interactions into one central location (just like your high school gym locker room!...err, cafeteria).
